The ideea of the project was to create a program that divides the audio file in smaller audio files to allow multiprocessing, as in a multimedia context the latency should be as little as posible. 

1) First, create 3 folders named exactly :
	
	- Batches   : after running the program here will be the audio segments of 30s of the initial audio
	- T_Batches : here will be segments of audio that consist of the last few seconds and first few seconds of the next 'batch'
		    - it was necesarry because if the target word was pronounced right at the transition the code would not identify it

	- Censored  : all the segments(both transition and normal ones) censored
	
2) Record yourself and create a wav file in the same folder as the ipynb file and the folders called :
	- 'identify.wav'

3) Make sure the file censor-beep-7.wav is also there

4) After stopping the recording the audio there should be a file XXXXXX_XXXXXX recorded_audio which represents:
								 YYMMDD_HHMMSS (which creates an unique identifier)
5) The censored file should be in censored
